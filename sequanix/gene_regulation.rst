Gene regulation example
============================

This page shows how to load and execute a Snakemake pipeline from the Gene-regulation library (Rioualen et al). We will use one of the pipeline for the demonstration that is the ChIP-seq pipeline. 

Independently of Sequana/Sequanix we will first need to install Gene-regulation package itself and then a set of data files to play with.
