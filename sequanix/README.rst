Sequanix

:Citations: 

This directory contains data and resources to demonstrate the usage of Sequanix.

Tutorials are available on Sequana documentation web page http://sequana.readthedocs.io/en/master/sequanix.html but we also provide complementary  materials in this repository (videos).

In the reference above, the online supplementary illustrates the usage of Sequanix on 4 different cases:

- a sequana pipeline (quality control)
- a minimalist example (unix commands only) with a configuration file or without
- a third-party example extracted from the Gene-regulation library.

All material and explanations for the the 2 first cases are available in the Sequana tutorial (link above) while the material for the Gene-regulation case are available on this dedicated page: `Gene regulation material <https://github.com/sequana/resources/tree/master/sequanix/gene_regulation.rst>`_. A video is also available in the ./videos directory.

We also provide a tutorial/video of for one of Sequana  pipeline (quality
control) in the ./videos directory.

Here below is a snapshot of Sequanix, a GUI for snakemake pipelines.
