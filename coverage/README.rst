Overview
===========

This directory contains the data files required to execute the notebook called "generate_paper_figures.ipynb", which generates some of the figures provided in this manuscript https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/08/092478



There are also a few other notebooks that complemented the main notebook. Here is a short summary:
